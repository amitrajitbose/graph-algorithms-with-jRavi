A Minimum Spanning Tree is the Spanning Tree of a graph of least weight. A graph can
have several MST. A Spanning Tree is any tree that includes all of the vertices of the
graph. Thus given a graph with N vertices, a spanning tree will have N-1 edges.


Two major algorithms for MST: 1) Prims 2) Kruskals

1) Prims works only with connected graphs, returns a MST
2) Kruskals works even with disconnected graphs, returns an MST or a forest of MSTs

Prims algorithm is a GREEDY algorithm to find the minimal spanning tree for a WEIGHTED
UNDIRECTED graph.Refer slides for algorithm.

Kruskal's algorithm is also a GREEDY algorithm to find a minimal spanning tree
for a WEIGHTED UNDIRECTED graph. The can be disconnected. Refer slides for
algorithm.
